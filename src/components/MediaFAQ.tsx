    question: "Who leads Yak Media's media strategy?",
    answer: "Our media strategy is led by platform specialists who manage campaigns hands-on every day. Each team member specializes in 1-2 platforms maximum, ensuring deep expertise rather than surface-level knowledge across many channels. Your Google Ads specialist lives in Google Ads, your Meta specialist knows every Facebook feature."
  },
  {
    question: "What platforms do you run ads on?",
    answer: "We focus on the platforms that drive real business results: Meta (Facebook & Instagram), Google (Search, Display, YouTube), TikTok, LinkedIn, Snapchat, Pinterest, and Reddit. We're platform-agnosticâ€”we follow your audience, not the latest trend. If your customers are there, we can reach them effectively."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Yak Media's approach different?",
    answer: "We optimize for business outcomes, not vanity metrics. While others chase reach and impressions, we focus on metrics that actually matter to your bottom line: cost per acquisition, return on ad spend, lifetime value, and revenue growth. Every campaign is designed to deliver measurable business results."
  },
  {
    question: "What kind of results can I expect?",
    answer: "Results vary by industry and starting point, but our clients typically see 25-40% improvement in key performance metrics within the first 90 days. We focus on sustainable, scalable growth rather than short-term spikes. Most importantly, we'll show you exactly how our media spend translates to business growth."
